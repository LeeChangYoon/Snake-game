1. First, comments would be added, and ppt file wil be uploaded.

2. Next, bomb will be added.

3. Then, I will make levels for this. There are three stages and each stage has different speed and number of bombs.

4. Finally, after all of this, our class will make the maze by using what we've learned from the snake game.
